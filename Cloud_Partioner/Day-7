1 - What is an RDS? How do you migrate an existing data base server in Amazon?

RDS is a Platform as a Service offering from AWS. Here AWS take care of the hardships 
of managing a server. We will get an Endpoint, just need to point this in our main EC2 or
wherever you need.

Personally I felt RDS to be a powerful service, it always helped me in other DB related issues.

It has Multi A-Z deployment (which is not under free tier), automated backups, logs and lot of other features.

Currently it provides Amazon Aurora (the most powerful DB I have ever used-but be careful to have a
look at the pricings), MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

For migration, you can use AWS Database Migration Service or traditional method (taking dump file from one and import to RDS)

2 - What is the significance of the AWS Shared Security Responsibility model?

Basically it means:

A - Amazon is responsible for the security of the cloud
B - You are responsible for security in the cloud
Concrete examples:

Amazon is supposed to ensure:

A - Your network traffic is only visible in the networks/security groups/machines/etc. you authorize
B - Your EC2 server doesn’t have spyware in the firmware that is sending your data off somewhere
C - Your data stored in S3 is not reachable except by sources you configure / API keys associated with your account.
You are supposed to ensure:

A - There are no vulnerabilities in your application
B - Only authorized users have access to your API keys and passwords
C - The software stack you install, for example, on EC2 is patched and secure
So, here are some scenarios:

A - Preventing the physical theft of hard drives from a datacenter - Amazon’s job
B - Preventing a disgruntled employee from closing your AWS account and deleting all your data - Your job
C - Ensuring there isn’t malware in the hypervisor running your Linux machines on EC2 - Amazon’s job
D - Ensuring your Apache server is patched - Your job
E - Ensuring only necessary ports are configured open in your firewal - Your job
F - Ensuring network traffic to blocked ports is rejected - Amazon’s job
G - Preventing hackers from using SQL injection, cross site scripting, phishing, social engineering, etc., etc. to access your systems - Your job
