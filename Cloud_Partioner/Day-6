1 - Elasticache

Elasticache is primarily used when you want to access your frequently accessed data or results of
queries to be available faster. Cache is primarily used with your Database to ensure that the most
frequently accessed query results can be delivered faster. The right use case would be user session
information, session time out value, counters etc.

If you are looking to cache static assets such as images, css or js files, Elasticache is not the
right option. Instead go for AWS CloudFront (or an equivalent if you want to go for a non AWS
service such as Cloudflare, Akamai etc) which is a content delivery service and can cache your 
content and render them each time a http(s) request is made

2 - What is the difference between ElastiCache and DynamoDB Accelerator in AWS?

DynamoDB accelerator is used to cache DynamoDB results and speed up queries to that service.
ElastiCache supports both Redis and and Memcached; it provides a managed service that offers 
the capabilities of those two caching products. Typically, those products are used to cache
results from relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL. So, in effect, the question is 
whether you want to use DynamoDB or another datastore, one that is (typically) a relational 
database. Both ElastiCache and DynamoDB will speed up the performance of the underlying datastore;
you just need to decide which datastore you prefer for your application.

3 -- Amazon Redshift


Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed, cloud-ready data warehouse service that you can easily integrate 
together with other BI tools that you have. To make this warehouse work, you just need to Extract, 
Transform, and Load into the warehouse and it can help you with the rest of the work.

Since this warehouse comes from Amazon, it will make life easier. You can start with some of their
basic plans of a few hundred gigabytes for the data, scaling up and down easily based on the current
demands that your company has. This makes it easier for you to leverage any data that you acquire to
help make your business easier.

To launch the warehouse, you just need to launch a set of nodes, which is known as the Redshift
cluster. Once you have been able to provision the cluster, you will find your sets of data are 
easy to uploaded to run any query. With Redshift, you are able to take advantage of fast query
performance, no matter how big or small your set of data, which helps you to get work done.
