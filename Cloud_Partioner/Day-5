1 - Aurora

It is the AWS DB engine based on Postgresql and MySQL open source databases.

It is offered as a database engine for AWS RDS (relational database as service) and it is quite cool 
although the performance to cost ratio may be less than ideal, and users need to reserve I/O in advance for 
a decent performance.

Alternate scalable / elastic relational databases as a Service include Google Cloud Spanner, Cockroach DB 
from Cockroach Labs, and even AWS RDS with Postgresql engine.

Other NewSQL databases like TiDb, Volt Db, or Postgresql clustering solutions like Citus address also worth a look.

2 - How does Amazon Aurora work behind the scenes?

Amazon has not been very transparent about that as yet. There was a project with that name some years ago that
was built around Informix structures, not a bad foundation, however there is talk around that it is InnoDB based, 
except that the storage model is more like Hadoop.

In any case, when they formally release it to beta testers, and then to the general public, this lack of information
will have to be remedied, as without understanding, and being able to trust it, large scale adoption will not happen.

3 --Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that offers fast and predictable performance with perfect scalability. 
DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a distributed database, so you don't have to worry
about hardware provisioning, installation, and maintenance. cluster configuration, replication, patching, or scaling. DynamoDB 
also offers encryption at rest, eliminating the operational burden and complexity of protecting sensitive data. For more information, 
see DynamoDB Encryption at Rest.


With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of demand traffic.
You can increase or decrease the performance capacity of your tables without downtime or performance degradation. You can use the
AWS Management Console to monitor resource usage and performance metrics.
